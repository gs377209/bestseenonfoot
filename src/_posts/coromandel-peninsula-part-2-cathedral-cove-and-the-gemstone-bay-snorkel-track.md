Hey everyone! Lauren here to tell you about our experience with Cathedral Cove and Gemstone Bay on the Coromandel Peninsula on the north island of New Zealand!

## Getting to Cathedral Cove

On our last day on the Coromandel Peninsula, we decided to go to Cathedral Cove. Before we made our way to the cove, Gerrod and I went to a local cafe to get some work done. Our hostel had very poor wifi, so we stayed at the cafe for nearly 2 hours to finish everything we needed to before leaving!

The drive from our hostel to the parking area off Hahei Beach Road took about 30-40 minutes. Normally you can park at a carpark right at the start of the Cathedral Cove walking path, but during the summer month it is too busy so you have to park further away. The parking lot was very full, but we luckily found a parking spot fairly quick.

There were several signs indicating that there was a 5 dollar shuttle to the start of the trail, but Gerrod and I are cheap and decided to walk. There are also several tours that take you there by boat or kayak, but again, Gerrod and I are cheap.

## The Walk to Cathedral Cove

The walk to the trail only added about 20-30 minutes, but was along the road uphill. It was pretty steep, but not 5 dollars steep. The walking track itself was paved with a few hills, and had absolutely STUNNING views of the coastline. There were a few turn offs along the path that lead to Gemstone Bay and a place called Mares Leg.

It was very sunny and hot so when we walked down the final stairs to the beach near Cathedral Cove I was so excited! The beach had beautiful white sand and steep cliffs on either side. On one side was the beautiful Cathedral Cove!

Cathedral Cove is a naturally formed rock archway along the coast. I actually first saw the cove in Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian, and thought it was beautiful. The ceiling of the cove was so high above us, and as you walked through you could see another beautiful beach on the other side.

## Cove Exploring and Rock Jumping

After we walked all the way to the cove, we decided to explore the beach. There were a few caves that you can enter during low tide, which is fortunately when we were at the beach. One cove you actually had to swim into!

There was a large rock that people were jumping off of, so of course Gerrod and I had to give it a try. Gerrod went first, and then I followed, stupidly forgetting I still had my sunglasses on my face. There were temporarily lost at the bottom, but fortunately some kid with a snorkel mask was nearby and helped us retrieve them.

On the northern side of the cove was a large, interesting, and beautiful rock. There were so many birds nesting on a large rock that Gerrod deemed it “Bird Rock”. The seagulls were so protective of their young that they even dove at us if we got too close to the rock. After we looked at a map of the cove, it turns out the rock is actually called Te Hoho Rock. NOT bird rock.

## Gemstone Bay Snorkel Track

On our way back to the carpark from Cathedral Cove, we stopped at Gemstone Bay to go snorkeling! Gemstone Bay is right off the track to Cathedral Cove, and there is an established “snorkel trail” set up in the water. The “trail” consisted of four buoys with informational signs explaining the ocean life attached!

The beach was very rocky! Gerrod and I found a place to leave our stuff, and “rock hopped” to the water’s edge. The water was very cold, but it was unlike any ocean environment I had ever seen! There was kelp everywhere, and tons of fish swimming around. We saw several eagle rays gracefully swimming through the water.

Some guys were parked with their boat right next to the snorkel trail and were feeding the fish. They invited us to come closer so we watch up close. It was cool to see the fish all swarmed under the boat and zooming to eat the fish chunks; however since the area along Gemstone Bay and Cathedral Cove is in the Te-Whanganui-A-Hei Marine Reserve, feeding the fish is not allowed. Feeding any animal in their natural environment can alter their behavior so that they seek food from people rather than their natural environment!

## Heading Back to the Hostel

After finishing the swim around the bay, Gerrod and I were freezing and ready to get out of the water. After drying off and taking some pictures, we walked the rest of the way back to our car at the Hahei carpark. It was an amazing day, and a perfect way to spend our last day on the peninsula.

I wish we had more time to spend on the Coromandel Peninsula, but I find myself wishing I had more time everywhere we have been!

Until next time!

Lauren (and Gerrod)
