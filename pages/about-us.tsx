                We are Gerrod and Lauren Schirtzinger, a fairly average american
                couple that have been married since September 2017. We have
                always enjoyed traveling together, and have recently decided to
                take that passion to the next level. So, Gerrod quit his job,
                and Lauren’s boss was super-duper cool and is letting her take a
                leave of absence from work and we are taking a (hopefully) epic
                year-long trip around the world! While Lauren prefers to spend
                most of her time outdoors, Gerrod makes sure we occasionally
                talk to other travelers and explore museums and cities. Our goal
                is to share our travel stories so our family doesn’t think we
                are dead. Oh and to maybe inspire as many people as we can to
                live a life of adventure and not be afraid to explore the
                unknown. We invite you to share in our journey as we hike, dive,
                and explore the world as it was meant to be seen, on foot!

                Hi! My name is Lauren. I am currently 27, and I am from
                Columbus, Ohio, USA. Growing up, my parents frequently took me
                to local, state, and various national parks where we would spend
                most of our time hiking. Growing up in a nature oriented family
                molded me into a huge nature nerd. After I traveled to the
                Bahamas and took a marine biology course which included
                receiving my scuba certification, my love for travel and seeing
                all that nature has to offer was solidified. And so, I went on
                to receive a degree in environmental science from The Ohio State
                University (O-H anyone?).
              </p>
              <p>
                Post-graduation I received a job as an environmental scientist
                at a consulting firm. As I know that a large portion of you have
                no idea what an environmental consultant does, just know that it
                is a combo of hiking/surveying, writing, and identifying soils
                and plants. It is not a very glamorous job, and I frequently
                have dirt under my nails and scratches on my legs. However, I
                love nature and tend to identify plants for people even when
                they don’t ask and/or care to know what the plant is. I am
                excited to see as many places as possible where I have no clue
                what the plants are, and to see as many different habitats as
                possible!
              </p>

                Gerrod is also currently 27, and he is also from Columbus, Ohio,
                USA. According to Gerrod, “I don’t care what the about me says,
                what does yours say?” He grew up playing lots of video games and
                hanging out with cool people. He attended Ohio University, where
                he received a degree in electrical/computer engineering. Post
                graduation he received a job in computer programming building
                websites and doing a whole lot of stuff that I don’t understand.
                Gerrod is very go with the flow, and much like childhood Gerrod,
                loves playing video games and meeting cool people. He always
                pushes me to experience the local culture and not panic when
                things don’t go according to plan.
